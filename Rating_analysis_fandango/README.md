# Data processing and visualization project

## Review
Assessing the correct display of ratings on the online platform Fandango, which deals with ratings and reviews, also makes money from the sale of movie tickets.
Problem identification: Do these companies tend to over- or under-rate?


### Objective of the project:

**The goal of the project is to follow the steps based on the fivethirtyeight.com article about ratings and see if we can come to the same conclusions as in the article. 
It is necessary to determine whether Fandango provided inflated ratings in 2015 in order to sell more tickets.**

***To start the project, you need to download one of the versions of Jupyter Notebook and download 2 attached datasets. All necessary connections are inside***
