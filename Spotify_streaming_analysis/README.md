# Data processing and visualization project

The comparison between New York and Chicago is surrounded by myths. For example::
 * New York is a metropolis subjected to the rigid rhythm of the workweek.
 * Chicago is the windy city with its own unique tastes.

Using data from a popular music streaming service, you will compare the behavior of users in these two cities.

**Research Goal** â€” Test three hypotheses:
1. User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, this is manifested differently in New York and Chicago.
2. On Monday morning, certain genres dominate in New York, while different ones prevail in Chicago. Similarly, on Friday evening, different genres are preferred, depending on the city.
3. New York and Chicago prefer different genres of music. Pop music is more frequently listened to in New York, while Chicago more towards hip-hop
